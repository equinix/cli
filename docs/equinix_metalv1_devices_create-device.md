## equinix metalv1 devices create-device

Create a device

### Synopsis

Creates a new device and provisions it in the specified location. Device type-specific options are accepted.  For example, `baremetal` devices accept `operating_system`, `hostname`, and `plan`. These parameters may not be accepted for other device types. The default device type is `baremetal`.

Use --request flag to provide optional JSON payload fields.

The default setting of false ensures that iPXE will be used on only the first boot.

Either metro or facility must be provided.  The API will accept either a single facility { \"facility\": \"f1\" }, or it can be instructed to create the device in the best available datacenter `{ \"facility\": \"any\" }`.  Additionally it is possible to set a prioritized location selection. For example `{ \"facility\": [\"f3\", \"f2\", \"any\"] }` can be used to prioritize `f3` and then `f2` before accepting `any` facility. If none of the facilities provided have availability for the requested device the request will fail.

In the API shorthand syntax, all features listed are required:  ``` { \"features\": [\"tpm\"] } ```  Alternatively, if you do not require a certain feature, but would prefer to be assigned a server with that feature if there are any available, you may specify that feature with a `preferred` value. The request will not fail if we have no servers with that feature in our inventory. The API offers an alternative syntax for mixing preferred and required features:  ``` { \"features\": { \"tpm\": \"required\", \"raid\": \"preferred\" } } ```  The request will only fail if there are no available servers matching the required `tpm` criteria.

Alternatively, next-available can be specified to select from any of the available hardware reservations. An error will be returned if the requested reservation option is not available.

The same hostname may be used on multiple devices within a project.
      --create-device-request-device-create-in-facility-input-ip_addresses ip_addresses attribute will allow you to specify the addresses you want created with your device.  The default value configures public IPv4, public IPv6, and private IPv4.  Private IPv4 address is required. When specifying    The ip_addresses attribute will allow you to specify the addresses you want created with your device.  The default value configures public IPv4, public IPv6, and private IPv4.  Private IPv4 address is required. When specifying ip_addresses`, one of the array items must enable private IPv4.  Some operating systems require public IPv4 address. In those cases you will receive an error message if public IPv4 is not enabled.  For example, to only configure your server with a private IPv4 address, you can send `{ \"ip_addresses\": [{ \"address_family\": 4, \"public\": false }] }`.  It is possible to request a subnet size larger than a `/30` by assigning addresses using the UUID(s) of ip_reservations in your project.  For example, `{ \"ip_addresses\": [..., {\"address_family\": 4, \"public\": true, \"ip_reservations\": [\"uuid1\", \"uuid2\"]}] }`  To access a server without public IPs, you can use our Out-of-Band console access (SOS) or proxy through another server in the project with public IPs enabled.

In the API shorthand syntax, all features listed are required:  ``` { \"features\": [\"tpm\"] } ```  Alternatively, if you do not require a certain feature, but would prefer to be assigned a server with that feature if there are any available, you may specify that feature with a `preferred` value. The request will not fail if we have no servers with that feature in our inventory. The API offers an alternative syntax for mixing preferred and required features:  ``` { \"features\": { \"tpm\": \"required\", \"raid\": \"preferred\" } } ```  The request will only fail if there are no available servers matching the required `tpm` criteria.

      --create-device-request-device-create-in-metro-input-ip_addresses ip_addresses attribute will allow you to specify the addresses you want created with your device.  The default value configures public IPv4, public IPv6, and private IPv4.  Private IPv4 address is required. When specifying       The ip_addresses attribute will allow you to specify the addresses you want created with your device.  The default value configures public IPv4, public IPv6, and private IPv4.  Private IPv4 address is required. When specifying ip_addresses`, one of the array items must enable private IPv4.  Some operating systems require public IPv4 address. In those cases you will receive an error message if public IPv4 is not enabled.  For example, to only configure your server with a private IPv4 address, you can send `{ \"ip_addresses\": [{ \"address_family\": 4, \"public\": false }] }`.  It is possible to request a subnet size larger than a `/30` by assigning addresses using the UUID(s) of ip_reservations in your project.  For example, `{ \"ip_addresses\": [..., {\"address_family\": 4, \"public\": true, \"ip_reservations\": [\"uuid1\", \"uuid2\"]}] }`  To access a server without public IPs, you can use our Out-of-Band console access (SOS) or proxy through another server in the project with public IPs enabled.

The special metro value of any means anywhere, any metro. When any is chosen in the request, the metro location is picked per our scheduling algorithms that favor the following factors: hardware reservation location (if requesting reserved hardware), ip reservations, spot instances, etc. The any keyword *does not* optimize for cost, this means that usage costs (instance, transfer, other features dependent on location) will vary. Please check metro value in response to see where the device was created. Either metro or facility must be provided.

      --create-device-request-device-create-in-metro-input-user_ssh_keys user_ssh_keys                                                                                                                                                                                                                       A list of UUIDs identifying the users that should be authorized to access this device (typically via /root/.ssh/authorized_keys).  These keys will also appear in the device metadata.  The users must be members of the project or organization.  If no SSH keys are specified (user_ssh_keys, `project_ssh_keys`, and `ssh_keys` are all empty lists or omitted), all parent project keys, parent project members keys and organization members keys will be included. This behaviour can be changed with 'no_ssh_keys' option to omit any SSH key being added. (JSON array)

Userdata is fetched and interpreted by the operating system installed on the device. Acceptable formats are determined by the operating system, with the exception of a special iPXE enabling syntax which is handled before the operating system starts.  See [Server User Data](https://deploy.equinix.com/developers/docs/metal/server-metadata/user-data/) and [Provisioning with Custom iPXE](https://deploy.equinix.com/developers/docs/metal/operating-systems/custom-ipxe/#provisioning-with-custom-ipxe) for more details.
